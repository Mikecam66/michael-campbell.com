<H1 style ="text-align: center;">TIMBER TREATMENT AND FLOOR REPAIRS TO A 1920S FLAT IN CAMBRIDGE </H1><br>
<p align="justify">
I was invited to look at an inter-war period property in Cambridge that was suffering from heavy insect infestation to a suspended timber floor.
The initial inspection revealed a large hole in the floorboards where Anobium Punctatum had weakened the boards causing them to collapse when stepped on by the owner!
<BR><BR>
The infestation was still active, and frass was strewn throughout the sub-floor void. Many of the joists were in very poor condition, and the floorboards were heavily infested across the undersides, quickly turning into a job that was far more severe than first appeared.
<br><br>
Once enough boards were lifted to ascertain the full extent of the damage, we set to work with a Permethrin based spray timber treatment, and repairs to the heavily damaged structural timbers of the floor. Finally we reinstated the floorboards, replacing any sufficiently boards with new softwood equivalents. The ventilation was improved with additional air-bricks, and the remaining terracotta air-bricks were replaced with new metal equivalents, providing greater airflow.
Client was extremely happy, and could sleep sound knowing her floor was safe and secure.
