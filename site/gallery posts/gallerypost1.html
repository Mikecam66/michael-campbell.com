<H1 style ="text-align: center;">DAMP-PROOFING AN INTER-WAR FLAT IN CAMBRIDGE </H1><br>
<p align="justify">
This ground floor flat has had the ground levels built up considerably over the years, to the point where the damp-proof course is no visible above ground. 
This has allowed moisture to track into the walls, causing dampness to the plastering, and saturating the cavity wall insulation. 
<BR><BR>
The radiators were removed internally, and all floors were covered up in preparation for the damp-proofing. 
<br><br>
The plaster was removed up to window cill height, and a new chemical damp-proof course was injected into the brickwork above floor level. A vertical injected DPC at each end of the wall isolates the newly damp-proofed area from any abutting walls. 
<br><br>
A coat of aqueous bitumen was applied to the base of the wall prior to plastering. The brickwork below the cill was a complete mess! Plastering to this area will be difficult as everything was crumbling as soon as it was touched. Some remedial works are required to get it ready. 
<br><br>
A section of expanded metal lath was applied over the damaged brickwork to give the clients plasterer a firm key to render onto. Job done. </p>
